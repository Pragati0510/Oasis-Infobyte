    In 1542, she was married to Dalpat Shah, the adopted son of the king Sangram Shah of the Garha Kingdom. According to Abul Fazl, Dalpat Shah was the son of a Kachhwaha Rajput adopted by the Raja of Garha Mandla. The Chandel of mahoba mandla and Kalachuris of Garha Kingdom dynasty (Garha Mandla) dynasties were allied because of this marriage..<br><br>
    Dalpat Shah died in 1550 and due to the young age of Vir Narayan, Durgavati took the reins of the Gondwana kingdom. Diwan Beohar Adhar Simha and Minister Man Thakur helped the Rani in looking after the administration successfully and effectively. Rani Durgavati promoted peace, trade, and good will throughout her realm[<br><br>
<br></br>
   Rani Durgavati moved her capital to Chauragarh in place of Singorgarh fort. It was a fort of strategic importance situated on the Satpura hill range[6]

    <strong>
        To fight a defensive battle, she went to Narrai, situated between a hilly range on one side and two rivers Gaur and Narmada on the other side. It was an unequal battle with trained soldiers and modern weapons in multitude on the Mughal side and a few untrained soldiers with old weapons on the side of Rani Durgavati. Her Faujdar Arjun Das was killed in the battle and the Rani decided to lead the defense herself. As the enemy entered the valley, the soldiers of the Rani attacked them. Both sides lost some men but the Rani lost more.</strong> <br><br>
